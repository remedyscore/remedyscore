<p style="color: grey"><i>An overview of chronic diseases and their frequency within the United States</i></p>


<!--more-->

A chronic disease is a detrimental and long-lasting condition that often persists over a person's entire life.  Approximately [60% of adults](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm) in the United States suffer from a chronic disease â€“ with 40% of the adult population suffering from two or more chronic diseases.  While not all chronic diseases are fatal, they remain a leading cause of death and disability. 

In the United States the [most common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876976/) chronic diseases are:

* High blood pressure (hypertension)

* Alzheimer's disease

* Heart disease

* Depression

* Arthritis

* Osteoporosis

* Diabetes

* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

* Irritable bowel syndrome

* Chronic kidney disease 

Given their persistent nature, chronic diseases are both financially costly to treat and emotionally costly to endure.
