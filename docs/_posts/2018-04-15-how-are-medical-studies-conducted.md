A standard research study is a randomized, blinded study with a control group that eventually includes humans (not animals).  Without these attributes, it is possible that the results of the study might be too compromised to base medical decisions upon.

With this context, the lifecycle of clinical research is often broken into three phases; these phases occur after any laboratory testing done on animals:
 
* **Phase I:**  An intervention is tested on a small number of healthy participants to discover a safe dose range and pick-up potential side effects.

* **Phase II:**  An invention is tested for a short period of time (weeks) on a small group of patients suffering from a particular malady to discover if the treatment has any impact on the illness. 

* **Phase III:**  An intervention is tested for an extended period of time (months) on a large group of patients (thousands, potentially) suffering from a particular malady to discover the general effectiveness of the treatment. 

Patients typically have their demographic information recorded â€“ including age, gender, ethnicity, socio-demographics, and geographic location.  As well, details of the intervention are recorded, including application method (oral, intravenous, etc.), dosage, frequency, and length of treatment.  

Throughout the study, researchers will ask themselves the following questions when engaging patients: 

* **Screening:**  Who has the disease?

* **Diagnosis:**  What causes the symptoms?

* **Prognosis:**  What outcome is likely?

* **Staging:**  How advanced is the disease?

* **Stratification:**  How will the patient respond to therapy?

* **Response:**  How effective was the treatment?

* **Monitoring:**  Is the disease controlled?

* **Surveillance:**  Has the disease progressed or returned?
