When deciding to combine together multiple medical studies using their effect sizes, it is important to clearly understand what is being measured by the pooled effect size.

For example, when studies are measuring the nutritional value of apples and oranges, you can pool these together - but now you are measuring the nutritional value of fruit.  Conversely, if a study was hoping to measure the nutritional benefits of just citrus fruits, the inclusion of apples would be incorrect.

For this reason, RemedyScore summarizes the effect size of (1) a study's individual endpoints, (2) the study based on all its endpoints, (3) a given endpoint across all studies, and (4) all studies.  This provides a steady gradation of results – from a specific endpoint within a specific study – to an aggregate view of all studies in a single number.  This allows a reader to transparently understand the component parts of aggregated effect sizes and view more precise results as desired.
