<p style="color: grey"><i>An overview of common biases in clinical studies, including selection, performance, reporting, and publication bias</i></p>


<!--more-->

While a research study may imply compelling results for a particular treatment, it is important to assess the quality of these results and ensure they are not [biased](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK91433/). 

Common types of bias in clinical research [include](http://community.cochrane.org/sites/default/files/uploads/inline-files/RevMan_5.3_User_Guide.pdf):

The commonly used [GRADE system](http://cccrg.cochrane.org/sites/cccrg.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/how_to_grade_revising_1_december_2016.pdf) of assessing clinical research also has a component called "[quality](http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com/x/set/static/ebm/learn/665072.html)" that mirrors many of the above biases, including questions surrounding:
 
* Blinding and allocation process

* Follow-up and withdrawals

* Sparse data

* Subject outcomes

These items mirror those reflected above, and treat them as a subset of other measures used when understanding a study's strength of evidence.
