The [Partial Area Under the Curve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15900606) ("pAUC") is sometimes viewed as a substitute for the Area Under the Curve ("AUC"), as it only considers those regions of the ROC space where data have been observed, however:

* The test is fairly sensitive to heterogeneity

* Comparisons between tests are more difficult, especially if an empirical truncation process is used; and 

* The partial area lacks a useful symmetry property enjoyed by the full AUC.

Consequently, the full AUC is preferable to the partial AUC for purposes of conducting a meta-analysis.
