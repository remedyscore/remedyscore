A clinical study researches a specific intervention with a group of patients, often utilizing some form of control.  The results of a clinical study can be summarized in a few different ways:
 
* **Meta-Analysis:** A meta-analysis is a statistical means of comparing and combining quantitative results from several similar clinical studies.  By combining together multiple clinical studies, it is possible to provide greater statistical certainty behind the potential benefits of a given intervention.
   
* **Systematic Review:**  A study that will postulate a defined research question, include a reproducible method of collecting empirical evidence, a meta-analysis of this evidence (the quantitative or mathematical work), and an overall set of recommendations based on results from the meta-analysis.

* **Narrative or Literature Review:**  A report providing an overview or broad summary of the current state of a particular field, often incorporating multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and many, many clinical studies. 

Clinical studies can also be summarized on a qualitative or quantitative basis.  In general, a qualitative summary is viewed with less importance than a sound quantitative summary. 

Qualitative summaries might include:
 
* **Narrative Synthesis:**  A subjective review of studies to assess their effectiveness.  

* **Vote Counting:**  Comparing the number of positive studies to negative studies (or possibly positive, mixed, and negative studies).  

Quantitative summaries involve gathering data and calculating an effect size for each study.  An effect size provides a means of measuring the magnitude an intervention (medication) has on a specific outcome (decreased morbidity).  The method of calculating the effect size will vary based on the type of data recorded in a given study.  Common data types include:
   
* **Dichotomous Data:**  Binary data (dead or alive, cured or not cured, etc.)

* **Continuous Data:**  Numeric data along a range (weight, blood pressure, etc.)

* **Ordinal Data:**  Categorical data (Likert scales, mood scales, etc.)

* **Count Data:**   Number of incidences of an event (diarrhea, strokes, etc.)

* **Time To Event Data:**  Length of time until an event (death, hospitalization, etc.)

In general, dichotomous and continuous data are most likely - and it is recommended to convert ordinal data into one of these data-types based on the number of categories (two categories become dichotomous data, more than two categories become continuous data).

Once an effect size has been calculated for each study, these values can be combined together in a meta-analysis to arrive at an overarching effect size.  By deriving this overarching effect size, we can understand the direction, size, and consistency of multiple experimental interventions.  In turn, medical practitioners are able to make better decisions and allow their patients to live better lives.
