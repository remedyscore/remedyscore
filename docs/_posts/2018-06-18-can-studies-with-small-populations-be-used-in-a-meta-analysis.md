[Most](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609745/) meta-analyses include data from one or more small studies that individually lack the power to detect an intervention effect.  While there is no formal definition on what accounts for a small study, the [GRADE System](http://cccrg.cochrane.org/sites/cccrg.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/how_to_grade_revising_1_december_2016.pdf) of reviewing clinical studies believes that less 300 participants (Dichotomous Outcomes) or 400 participants (Continuous Outcomes) may call into question the precision of a particular meta-analysis.  Another [school of thought](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc11919) is that small studies are those with less than 100 participants in a given arm of the study (i.e.; less than 100 participants in the treatment or control arm).

While small studies are helpful to include in a meta-analysis [they](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc11919) [contain](http://skin.cochrane.org/sites/skin.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/CSG-COUSIN_March%202015_M%20Grainge.pdf) [numerous](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/92240/why-are-small-sample-sized-avoided-in-meta-analyses) [risks](http://www.goodbadandbogus.com/bad-science/why-you-really-cant-trust-small-studies-the-small-study-effect/): 

* **Publication Bias:**  Smaller studies typically get less air time in publications unless they showcase a positive result; which may encourage their authors to slant them as a success story.  The counter-point is that any meta-analysis should be analyzed and adjusted to compensate for publication bias. 

* **Study Quality:**  Smaller studies are argued to have a higher likelihood of lower quality controls and academic rigor by some proponents.  The counter-point is that because the studies are smaller they select and monitor patients in a more rigorous manner.

* **Diminished Importance:**  Smaller studies are mathematically weighted less in a meta-analysis, so there is an argument that the time to synthesize their data is largely wasted.  The counter-point is that the studies can represent additional context for any analysis - and as stated at the outset, most meta-analysis rely on some number of small studies.

In summary of the above, there is no concrete reason to eliminate or filter studies based on their population size.  However, given the perceived risks above, RemedyScore automatically flags any meta-analyses that featuring studies with a population below 100 by stating, "This analysis includes some studies with small participant groups. It may be useful to reference analysis around publication bias if provided above."
